## Purpose

To teach students the basics of Long Division with a step-by-step procedure.

### Functionality

Upon start, the user will be given a randomly generated 3-digit dividend and a 1-digit divisor.  The app will guide the user through the Divide-Multiply-Subtract procedure until the final quotient (including remainder).

If the user makes a mistake, the app will tell them.  If the user has trouble with a particular step, there is a calculator available to help.
